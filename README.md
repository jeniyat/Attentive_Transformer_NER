# Attentive Transformer Model for Fine Grained Software Entity Extraction

This repository contains the modified huggingface transformer version-2.8.0, where we utilized an embedding level attention to extract the fine-graied software entities as proposed in the paper:  **Code and Named Entity Recognition in  StackOverflow. (ACL 2020)**.  [[Paper PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01634.pdf)]
